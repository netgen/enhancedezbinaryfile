Enhanced eZBinaryfile Datatype: Version: 1.0
-------------------------------------

1. Context
----------
This datatype was developed to make it possible to send binary files collected from forms as multipart MIME emails.

2. Features
-----------
The Enhanced eZBinaryfile datatype makes it possible to use the information collector functionality to allow anonymous users to send files as attachments.

3. Example of use
-----------------
Enhanced eZBinaryfile can be used to allow people to attach documents to
contact forms.

4. Known bugs, limitations, etc.
-----------------------------
The datatype has the following limitations and bugs:

- Even with restrictions, it remains a potential security risk to allow
  anonymous users to upload binary files to the server.
- If the file is valid but the form fails for another reason the file is still      uploaded to the storage directory.
- When the collectedinfo is removed from the backend, the file is not removed.
- File types are only validated by the filename which is potentially dangerous.
- This makes use of the parsexml template operator (which is included) in the
  autoloads directory.  In the event that this template operator is already
  being loaded as an extension, then the autoload should be removed.
- Not tested with a cluster.  Shouldn't need cluster functionality anyway with
  the way it is set up now.
